## Attack Of The Vampire Pizzas
A simple pygame generated by following the book, "Code This Game" by Meg Ray. The purpose of this book was to teach beginners on how to use Python as they build their very own Pygame.

##My Story

I generated this game when I first wanted to learn about coding and using Python. I walked into Barnes n Nobles and didn't know exactly where to start or even which section will have the books I needed. After wandering around for about 10 minutes, I realized that maybe, I should learn Python from a children's perspective and work my way up. Its amazing to me to see how advanced education is now for them to have a coding section for kids. 

At first I thought, how hard can it be? Especially if this coding book is made for children. I was completely wrong. It was the most challenging thing I've ever came across. I am learning basic Python using cartoon characters to make it "easier." I later found myself learning OOP ( Object Oriented Programming), which is in Computer Science by the way, and I wanted to quit. Good thing I have a soft spot for adorable little critters and pizza so I continued to push through with finishing this game.

Months later, I finally completed the game and even though its not working properly, it still works and I can say I am very proud of building my very first Pygame.

Moral of the story: DO NOT UNDERESTIMATE CODING EVEN IF THEY PLACED THE WORDS "FOR CHILDREN" IN FRONT OF IT.
