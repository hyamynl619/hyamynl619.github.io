Just call me **Amy**, born and raised in ***Connecticut since 1992***. I was working in the banking industry for about 6 years and realized that
it's time for a change. Being a Data Scientist was a recent dream of mine after coming across a kid's book that teaches you how to generate a pygame, "Code this Game!" by: Meg Ray, and I've been obsessed ever since. I realized that not many people know what Data Science truly is and I've decided from now on, I will make it my life goal to educate those around me what Data Science is capable of. Us Data Scientists have the ability to change the world and yet, so little people know we exist.  


**Oh right, one of my qualities is being overly dramatic with a hint of severe perseverance syndrome.**
